# Band-Gap_Prediction
#### The main objective is to predict the band gap of various compounds based on their chemical and physical properties

- `compound-band-gap-prediction.csv` contains the dataset which i will be using in final
- This is a **Regression** problem, since the target variable is `band_gap` which is a continuous variable

### The Intended Approach

- Data prepration & cleaning
- Perfoming the EDA 
    - plots to visualize the data
- Run different regression models
    - Linear
    - RandomForest
    - Ridge
    - Lasso
    - Elastic Net
- Compare the Metrics
